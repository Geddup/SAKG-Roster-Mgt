  Follow these steps to create your volunteer roster calendar:
  <ol>
  <li>Input your SAKG session information into the <b>SAKG classes</b> sheet</li> 
  <li>Send your 'Request for SAKG volunteers' messages via Geddup</li>
  <li>Copy and paste your Geddup export files directly into the <b>Volunteers</b> sheet</li> 
  <li>Click <b>Add data</b> to push your sessions to the Raw Data sheet</li>
  <li>Click <b>Create calendar</b> to push all data into your Google calendar</li> 
  </ol>
  Note that as this is a free service, Google limits the amount of data that can be added or removed from calendars at one time.
  If you are managing a lot of data you may get an error message that says to wait before trying again.
  That's okay. The classes that have been 'Added' will be noted in the Raw Data sheet. Just click <b>Create calendar</b> again to restart the process.

   You can always re-open these instructions by clicking on <b>Getting Started</b> again.
