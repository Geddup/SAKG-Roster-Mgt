  Congratulations - you have completed the setup of your SAKG Roster. Your volunteer and session data has been added to your Google calendar.
  We recommend that you now manage any changes from within the calendar itself. Your volunteers have been copied to the SAKG Classes sheet too,
  if you are looking for a list of all volunteers by session...

  <p>
  If you know of any community group that would benefit from our tools, make sure you tell them about us!
  </p>
  <p>
  Thanks,</br>
  The Geddup Team
