  Congratulations - you have completed the setup of your SAKG Roster. Your volunteer and session data has been added to your Google calendar,
  which you can now use to manage your SAKG program as things change.
  </p>
  <p>
  If you know of any community group that would benefit from our tools, make sure you tell them about us!
  </p>
  <p>
  Thanks,</br>
  The Geddup Team
